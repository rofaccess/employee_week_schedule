# Module to build daily shifts.

module DailyShifts
  class << self
    # Build all shifts possibles for a day according worker availabilities.
    # @param availabilities [Array] A array of hashes with worker availabilities.
    # @return [Array] A array of arrays of all shifts built.
    # @todo The availabilities received has one availability by employee, that is, each employee has only one
    #       availability time range by day. An improvement may be support more the one time range by employee
    #       for one day.
    # @example
    #   availabilities = [
    #     { "start_time" => "19:00", "end_time" => "23:00", "worker" => "Sam" },
    #     { "start_time" => "19:00", "end_time" => "23:00", "worker" => "Dean" },
    #     { "start_time" => "19:00", "end_time" => "23:00", "worker" => "John" }
